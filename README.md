> CLI for searching tickets, organizations and users

## Preface

### Assumption and constraints

- User id is unique and ordered (Performance optimised using binary search)
- Organization id is unique and ordered (Performance optimised using binary search)
- User without verified set is assumed to be false

### Known problems (can be fixed at a later date)

- Ticket may not have an oganizationId, currently if ticket does not have organizationId, you can't find that.
